## Classwork

In the spirit of Sol LeWitt, today we're going to work on patterns.

**colors**  
Using the grid, create a variety of colors across this grid. It can be a grandient of one color, or a wider variety of colors. Hint: Use the RGB or HSB color modes. They use numbers so you can use the row and column variables as values.

**lines**  
Add to the pattern using the `line()` method across the grid. Try a few different ones out till you settle on a pattern you like. You can use multiple lines if you'd like.

**arcs**  
Continue to build on your pattern with the `arc()` method. This one is a bit trickier, so take a look at the p5.js reference page for examples.

**colors, part 2**  
Now that you have a few more shapes, try making those shapes their own unique colors.

**refinement**  
Feel free to add any additional elements to your pattern, or change the grid cellSize. If you used the `cellSize` variable you should be able to easily increase or decrease the size of your pattern.

Once you're satisfied with your pattern, save it to github and get started on your homework assignment.

## Homework: 100 Things

Create a drawing that has 100 or more things (lines, circles, cats, snowflakes, etc). It can be abstract or representational, as long as the work feels intentional. Each element should be slightly different in at least two of the following ways:

* location
* color
* size
* shape

Use the [random()](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) method so that every time you refresh your drawing it looks a little different.

This drawing should be very different from your classwork.
